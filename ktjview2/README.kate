In taskjuggler.xml you find a xml file for syntax highlighting
for kate, the KDE editor.

It will be installed to $KDEDIR/share/apps/katepart/syntax
for global or ~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax for personal
use.

The file was contributed by Remus Pereni <remus@nolimits.ro>

Updates and fixes by Joachim Werner <joe@suse.de> 
and Lukas Tinkl <lukas.tinkl@suse.cz>
