Probably:
- Macros to do date/time arithmetic.
- 'limits' for tasks, not just for allocations.
- Interactive account report

- Limit iCal calendar entries to actually allocated time slots.

Maybe:
- Make vacations and shifts scenario specific.

- Limits for accounts.
- support for renewable resources
- Allocation selection by skill set.
- Add support for flexible rates (per task, per shift)
- Cleanup taskjuggler library API, so it can be used by other apps.
- Color support for tasks and resources.
- Gap with snap on weekdays.
- Macros like ${TODAY}, ${ProjectStart}, ...
