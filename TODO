Work in progress (for next version):
- Add option to generate events instead of todos in ICalReport. (see
  http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2/index.php?t=msg&goto=6796&rid=65&S=f6e44759702ae7dc31918ca7fe3a4a7e#msg_6796)
- Add a property to htmlcalendar that suppresses the display of tasks
  on days where there is no time assigned to the task, for example
  holidays and weekends.
- Add an option to the htmlcalendar that allows you to suppress
  selected weekdays altogether. A calendar that does not have the
  Saturday and Sunday columns would not be as wide, and fit on the
  display.
   
    
Probably:
- Macros to do date/time arithmetic.
- 'limits' for tasks, not just for allocations.
- Interactive account report
- Add C++ style // comments.

Maybe:
- Make vacations and shifts scenario specific.
- Limits for accounts.
- support for renewable resources
- Allocation selection by skill set.
- Add support for flexible rates (per task, per shift)
- Cleanup taskjuggler library API, so it can be used by other apps.
- Color support for tasks and resources.
- Gap with snap on weekdays.
- Macros like ${TODAY}, ${ProjectStart}, ...
