Work in progress:
- 'allowoffhours' attribute for bookings
- less verbose booking syntax
- Split toolbar with zoom and scheduling icons.

Probably:
- Macros to do date/time arithmetic.
- 'limits' for tasks, not just for allocations.
- Interactive account report
- Add C++ style // comments.

Maybe:
- Make vacations and shifts scenario specific.
- Limits for accounts.
- support for renewable resources
- Allocation selection by skill set.
- Add support for flexible rates (per task, per shift)
- Cleanup taskjuggler library API, so it can be used by other apps.
- Color support for tasks and resources.
- Gap with snap on weekdays.
