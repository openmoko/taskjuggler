<chapter><title>Introduction</title>
<sect1><title>About TaskJuggler</title>

<para>TaskJuggler is a project planing tool for Linux and UNIX
system-based operating systems. Whether you want to plan your colleges
shifts for the next month or want to build a skyscraper - TaskJuggler
is the tool for you.</para>

<para>Instead of clicking yourself painfully through hundreds of
dialog boxes you specify your TaskJuggler project in a simple text
format.  You simply list all your tasks with their dependencies and
other properties. The information is sent through TaskJuggler and you
will get all sorts of reports in HTML or XML format. The HTML files
can be viewed and printed with any web browser that supports Cascading
Style Sheets. The XML files are used by the Gantt- and PERT chart
generators and the KDE Konqueror pluging.</para>

<para>TaskJuggler does not only honor the task interdependencies but
also takes resource constrains and prioritization into account. Using
TaskJuggler's powerful filtering and reporting algorithms you can
create task lists, resource usage tables, status reports, project
calendars and project accounting statements.</para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler is not contrained by the performance requirements
of real-time editing it can offer a much broader set of features not
found in any of the GUI based project planing tools. The the project
description language is easy to learn and supports you very
effectively during your planing process.</para>

<para>The official TaskJuggler web page can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/~freitag/taskjuggler">
http://www.suse.de/~freitag/taskjuggler</ulink>.</para>

<para> Since the developers are mostly busy project managers
themselves, we have created two forums for users to help each other.
</para>

<para>The TaskJuggler user mailing list is hosted by <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/en">SuSE</ulink>. You can subscribe at <ulink

<sect2><title>Version 1.3 (2002-07-30)</title>

<para> <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>This release features some bigger cleanup changes.
Some of them do break compatibility with older version of taskjuggler.
While we try very hard to avoid such situations, we do prefer to have
a consistent and logical language. Since the TaskJuggler user base is
still comparatively small, we decided to break compatibility now
rather than later. The changes are fairly minor, so they won't affect
many users.  Please see further down for more details.</para>

project information.</para>

<listitem><para>Added Pert-chart generator from Philippe
Midol-Monnet.</para>

properties as well but a warning is issued and they will be removed in
the next major release.</para>

<listitem><para><link
linkend="project_dailyworkinghours">dailyworkinghours</link>

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The optional attribute <link

only resources that have been allocated to a certain project in a
given time frame.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Made week of year calculation ISO 8601:1988 and DIN
1355 compliant. This also affects the month and year correlation in
weekly reports. You can use the optional project attributes <link

linkend="project_weekstartsmonday"> weekstartsmonday </link> to
specify wheter you like to start you week on Sunday or
Monday.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Support for a <computeroutput>flags</computeroutput>
columns added to HTML reports.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Sub tasks do now inherit the dependencies of their
container tasks. Specifying dependencies after sub tasks is now
illegal since they would be only used for checking, but not for
scheduling.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The logic checker for task attributes has been
completely rewritten. Since it probably catches some more errors, you
might have to fix your project now. Such cases would have resulted in
wrong results anyhow. Lots of test cases have been added to the test
suite to validate the checker.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The error reporting has been drastically improved. The
messages should be more precise now and errors that are triggered by
other errors should be not be so promiment anymore.</para></listitem>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Requirements</title>

<para>To build and run TaskJuggler, you need:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>qt3 &mdash; The <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source"> Qt C++ class library</ulink>
version 3.0 or higher</para>

<listitem><para> GNU Compiler Collection &mdash; We are currently
using GCC 3.2 to develop TaskJuggler. Since we try to write the code
platform independant and ANSI standard compliant it should work with
other compilers as well.</para>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para>This version of TaskJuggler was built and tested on SuSE Linux 8.1 on
various hardware platforms.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Compilation and Installation</title>
<para>
Before compiling TaskJuggler you need to set the
<computeroutput>QTDIR</computeroutput> environment variable to the
base directory of your Qt version. This is normally
<computeroutput>/usr/lib/qt3</computeroutput>.

To compile and install TaskJuggler on your system, type the following 
in the base directory of the TaskJuggler distribution:

<screen>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</screen>

</para><para>
Since TaskJuggler uses <computeroutput>autoconf</computeroutput>, you
should have no trouble compiling it. If you have problems, please
report them to the TaskJuggler developers mailing list at <ulink
url="mailto:taskjuggler-devel@suse.com">
taskjuggler-devel@suse.de</ulink> in English.</para>

</sect1>
</chapter> 
<chapter><title>Usage</title> 
<sect1><title>Basics</title>

<para>TaskJuggler uses one or more text files to describe a project.
The main project should be placed in a file with the
<computeroutput>.tjp</computeroutput> extension. This main project may
contain several subprojects. Such subprojects should be placed in
files with the <computeroutput>.tjsp</computeroutput> extension. These
subprojects are included in the main project during compile
time.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1><title> General Usage</title>

<para>TaskJuggler works like a compiler. You provide the source
files, it computes the contents and creates the output files.</para>

<para>Let's say you have a project file called
<filename>AcSo.tjp</filename>. It contains the tasks of your project
and their dependencies. To schedule the project and create report
files you have to ask TaskJuggler to process it.</para>

<para><screen>
% taskjuggler AcSo.tjp
</screen> </para>

<para>TaskJuggler will try to schedule all tasks with the specified
conditions and generate the reports that were requested with the <link
linkend="htmltaskreport">htmltaskreport</link>, <link
linkend="htmlresourcereport">htmlresourcereport</link> or other report
attributes in the input file.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1><title> The Command Line Options</title>

<para>To get a list of the command line options of TaskJuggler, use
the <computeroutput>--help</computeroutput> option:</para>

<para><screen>
% taskjuggler --help
</screen></para>

<para>Calling TaskJuggler with . as input filename will cause reading
from stdin. To redirect output to stdout you can specify -- as
filename for reports. This feature can for example be used to generate
dynamic html pages from CGI scripts.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1><title> Reporting Bugs and Sending Feedback</title>

<para>All official releases of TaskJuggler are meant to be stable
releases unless explicitly noted differently. But our test suite is
still very small and some features cannot be tested automatically very
well. So it's very likely that your current version of TaskJuggler
contains bugs. If you find a bug please follow this procedure:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>Read this manual to make sure that it is actually a
bug and not a feature.</para>

<listitem><para>Check the TaskJuggler <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/~freitag/taskjuggler">web page</ulink>.
Possibly the bug was already found and a patch or workaround
exists.</para>

<listitem><para>Try to create a test project that is as small as
possible but still reproduces the bug.</para>

<listitem><para>Send the test project and a detailed description of
the problem to the developer mailing list at <ulink
url="mailto:taskjuggler-devel@suse.com">taskjuggler-devel@suse.com</ulink>.</para>
