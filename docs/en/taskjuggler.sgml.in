<chapter><title>Introduction</title>
<sect1><title>About TaskJuggler</title>

<para>TaskJuggler is a project planing tool for Linux and UNIX
system-based operating systems. Whether you want to build a skyscraper
or plan your colleges shifts for the next month - TaskJuggler
is the tool for you.</para>

<para>Instead of clicking yourself painfully through hundreds of
dialog boxes you specify your TaskJuggler project in a simple text
format.  You specify all your tasks with their dependencies and
other properties using your favorit text editor. The information is
sent through TaskJuggler and you will get all sorts of reports in HTML
or XML format. The HTML files can be viewed and printed with any web
browser that supports Cascading Style Sheets. The XML files are used
by the Gantt- and PERT chart generators and the KDE Konqueror
plug-in.</para>

<para>TaskJuggler does not only honor the task interdependencies but
also takes resource constrains and prioritization into account. Using
TaskJugglers powerful filtering and reporting algorithms you can
create a variety of task lists, resource usage tables, status reports,
project calendars and project accounting statements.</para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler is not constrained by the performance requirements
of real-time editing it can offer a much broader set of features not
found in any of the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) project
planing tools. The the project description language is easy to learn
and supports you very effectively during your planing and tracking
process.</para>

<sect1><title>TaskJuggler on the Web</title>

<para>The official TaskJuggler web page can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org">
http://www.taskjuggler.org</ulink>.</para>

<para> Since the developers are mostly busy project managers
themselves, we have created two forums for users to help each other.
</para>

<para>The TaskJuggler user mailing list is hosted by <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/en">SuSE</ulink>. You can subscribe at <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/en/support/mailinglists">
http://www.suse.de/en/support/mailinglists/</ulink>.</para>

<para>The other forum is an IRC channel at <ulink
url="http://www.freenode.net">FreeNode.net</ulink>. The
channel is called #taskjuggler.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Requirements</title>

<para>TaskJuggler uses many additional tools. We have avoided to
re-invent the wheel again wherever possible, at the same time we tried
to keep the dependency list reasonably small. Nevertheless can it be
challenging to the unexperienced user to build and install TaskJuggler
from source code. Most users are probably better served by using
binary packages from their distributor. Some distributions even have
TaskJuggler included like the <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/en">SuSE</ulink> distribution.</para>

<para>This version of TaskJuggler was built and tested on SuSE Linux 8.1 on
various hardware platforms.</para>

<sect2><title>The command line tool taskjuggler</title>

<para>To build and run TaskJuggler, you need:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>qt3 &mdash; The <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source"> Qt C++ class library</ulink>
version 3.0 or higher</para>

<listitem><para> GNU Compiler Collection &mdash; We are currently
using GCC 3.2 to develop TaskJuggler. Since we try to write the code
platform independent and ANSI standard compliant it should work with
other compilers as well.</para>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para>These requirements are enough to build and use the command line
program that translates project descriptions into HTML or XML reports.
If you want to built this documentation or use the tools to process
the XML files you need to take care of additional dependencies. If any
of the following dependencies are not matched, the configure script
will issue a warning but will not fail.<para>

<sect2><title>Contributed Stuff</title>

<para>Serveral people have contributed useful tools for TaskJuggler
users. These tools can be found in the Contrib directory of the source
code package. Please refer to the included README files for
installation information.</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Compilation and Installation</title>
<para>
Before compiling TaskJuggler you need to set the
<computeroutput>QTDIR</computeroutput> environment variable to the
base directory of your Qt version. This is normally
<computeroutput>/usr/lib/qt3</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>To compile and install TaskJuggler on your system, type the following 
in the base directory of the TaskJuggler distribution:</para>

<para><screen>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</screen></para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler uses <computeroutput>autoconf</computeroutput>, you
should have no trouble compiling it. TaskJugger has some weak or
non-mandatory dependencies. If any of there are not satisfied, a
warning is issued. In case a mandatory dependency is not found, an
error is displayed and the configuration program stops. If you have
problems, please report them to the TaskJuggler mailing
list at <ulink url="mailto:taskjuggler@suse.com">
taskjuggler@suse.de</ulink> in English. Maybe someone there can help
you out.</para>

</sect1>
</chapter> 
<chapter><title>Usage</title> 
<sect1><title>Basics</title>

<para>TaskJuggler uses one or more text files to describe a project.
The main project should be placed in a file with the
<computeroutput>.tjp</computeroutput> extension. This main project may
contain several sub-projects. Such sub-projects should be placed in
files with the <computeroutput>.tjsp</computeroutput> extension. These
sub-projects are included in the main project during compile
time.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1><title> General Usage</title>

<para>TaskJuggler works like a compiler. You provide the source
files, it computes the contents and creates the output files.</para>

<para>Let's say you have a project file called
<filename>AcSo.tjp</filename>. It contains the tasks of your project
and their dependencies. To schedule the project and create report
files you have to ask TaskJuggler to process it.</para>

<para><screen>
% taskjuggler AcSo.tjp
</screen> </para>

<para>TaskJuggler will try to schedule all tasks with the specified
conditions and generate the reports that were requested with the <link
linkend="htmltaskreport">htmltaskreport</link>, <link
linkend="htmlresourcereport">htmlresourcereport</link> or other report
attributes in the input file.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1><title> The Command Line Options</title>

<para><simplelist type=horiz columns=2>

<member>--help</member>
<member>Print all command line options with a short
description.</member>

<member>--version</member>
<member>Print the version and copyright info.</member>

<member>-v</member><member>Same as '--version'.</member>

<member>-s</member><member>Stop TaskJuggler run after syntax check.
This option is for testing and debugging purposes only.</member>

<member>--nodepcheck</member>
<member>Do not check for dependency loops. The loop detector uses an
algorithm that needs exponentially more time the bigger the dependency
network gets. So for large projects it can be desireable to skip the
dependency loop detection. This does not affect the task scheduling
but can lead to error messages that are difficult to associate with a
flawed dependency specification.</member>

<member>--debug N</member>
<member>Print debug output, N must be between 0 and 4, the higher N
the more output is printed. This option is for testing and debugging
purposes only.</member>

<member>--dbmode N</member>
<member>Limit debug output to certain modules of the code. N is a bit
mask. Each set bit actives output of a certain module. Currently the
following modules are supported: Project File Reader (1), Project
Scheduler (2), Task Scheduler (4), Resource Scheduler (8), Expression
Tree Evaluator (16). This option is for testing and debugging purposes
only.</member>

<member>--updatedb</member>
<member>Update the Kotrus database with the new resource usage
information.</member>

</simplelist></para>

<para>Calling TaskJuggler with . as input filename will cause reading
from stdin. To redirect output to stdout you can specify -- as
filename for reports. This feature can for example be used to generate
dynamic HTML pages from CGI scripts.</para>

<sect1><title> Reporting Bugs and Sending Feedback</title>

<para>All official releases of TaskJuggler are meant to be stable
releases unless explicitly noted differently. But our test suite is
still very small and some features cannot be tested automatically very
well. So it's very likely that your current version of TaskJuggler
contains some bugs. If you find a bug please follow this
procedure:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>Read this manual to make sure that it is actually a
bug and not a feature.</para>

<listitem><para>Check the TaskJuggler <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org">web page</ulink>.
Possibly the bug was already found and a patch or workaround
exists.</para>

<listitem><para>Try to create a test project that is as small as
possible but still reproduces the bug.</para>

<listitem><para>Send the test project and a detailed description of
the problem to the developer mailing list at <ulink
url="mailto:taskjuggler-devel@suse.com">taskjuggler-devel@suse.com</ulink>.</para>
