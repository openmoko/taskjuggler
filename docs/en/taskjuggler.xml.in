This document describes TaskJuggler version @VERSION@
</para>

<para>The <application>TaskJuggler</application> manual consists of
two parts. The first part contains general usage information and a
tutorial. The tutorial is highly recommended for all first-time
TaskJuggler users. It is a very good introduction to many TaskJuggler
concepts and features. The second part is the language
reference.</para>

<chapter id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<sect1 id="about_taskjuggler"><title>About TaskJuggler</title>

<para>TaskJuggler is a modern and powerful project management tool. Its new
approach to project planning and tracking is far superior to the
commonly used Gantt chart editing tools. It has already been
successfully used in many projects and scales easily to projects with
hundreds of resources and thousands of tasks.</para>

<para>TaskJuggler is an Open Source tool for serious project managers. It
covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the
first idea to the completion of the project. It assists you during
project scoping, resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, risk
and communication management.</para>

<para>TaskJuggler provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your
project time lines and resource assignments based on the project
outline and the constrains that you have provided. The built-in
resource balancer and consistency checker offload you from having to
worry about irrelevant details and ring the alarm if the project gets
out of hand. Its flexible "as many details as necessary"-approach
allows you to still plan your project as you go, making it also ideal
for new management strategies such as Extreme Programming and Agile
Project Management.</para>

<para>If you are about to build a skyscraper or just want to put together
your colleague's shift plan for the next month, TaskJuggler is the
right tool for you. If you just want to draw nice looking Gantt charts
to impress your boss or your investors, TaskJuggler might not be right
for you. It takes some effort to master its power, but it will become
a companion you don't want to miss anymore.</para>

<para>The official TaskJuggler web site can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org">
http://www.taskjuggler.org</ulink>.</para>

<para>Since the developers are mostly busy project managers
themselves, we have created a <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2">forum</ulink> for users to
help each other.</para>

</sect1>
&ChangeLog;
<sect1 id="how_to_contribute"><title>How to Contribute</title>

<sect2 id="why_contribute"><title>Why contribute?</title>

<para>TaskJuggler is an Open Source Project. It was developed by
volunteers mostly in their spare time. Made available under the GNU
General Public license and similar licenses, TaskJuggler can be shared
and used free of charge by anybody who respects the license
conditions. Does that mean you can use it without worrying about
anything? Clearly not! Though users have no legal obligation to
contribute, you should feel a moral obligation to support Open Source
in whatever way you can. This can range from helping out other
users with their first Linux installation to actively contributing to
the TaskJuggler Project, not just as a programmer. The following section
describes, how you can
contribute to any of the components that are part of the TaskJuggler
software releases.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="preparing_a_contribution"><title>Preparing a
contribution</title>

<para>All TaskJuggler development is coordinated using the <ulink
url="http://git.or.cz/">git</ulink> revision control system. All
changes must be submitted using git so that we can track the
authorship of each submission. To contribute you need to have at
least git version 1.5.0 installed. As a first step, you need to
checkout the latest version of the TaskJuggler. This will create a
directory called <varname>taskjuggler</varname> in your current
directory. It not only contains the latest sources, but also the full
revision history of the code. It is your local copy of the TaskJuggler
source repository.</para>

<screen>git clone http://www.taskjuggler.org/git-repos/taskjuggler.git
</screen>

<para>If you have never used git before, you need to configure it
first. You need to set your name and email address. This information
will be present in all patches that you submit.</para>

<screen>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "firstname.lastname@domain.org"
</screen>

<para>You then need to configure and install the TaskJuggler version.
Make sure, you have removed all other instances of TaskJuggler removed
from you system before doing so. It is a common mistake to have an old
version of the TaskJuggler library used by a newer version of the
executables.</para>

<screen>cd taskjuggler
make -f Makefile.cvs
./configure # Put your options here (see ./configure --help
for details)
make
# Run as root
make install
</screen>

<para>Do not use the development snapshots and send your patches as
plain diff files. After having switched to git, we no longer accept
such patches.</para>

<para>Next you need to find the files where you want to make your
modifications. Sometimes files will be generated from
other files. Do not change those generated files. Your changes will be
overwritten the next time you call the make utility. To identify those
files, some familiarity with make and other Linux tools are
helpful. Whenever there is a file with the same base name and the extension
<varname>.in</varname> in the same directory, then the file is
generated from the <varname>.in</varname>-file. You need to modify the
<varname>.in</varname>-file, not the one with just the base name. Another
indicator is the fact that the file is not part of the repository. With few
exceptions the repository does not contain any generated files.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="creating_a_patch"><title>Creating a Patch</title>

<para>When you are done with your changes, it's a good idea to test
them. In the <varname>taskjuggler</varname> directory run the
following commands. </para>

<screen>make
# Run as root
make install
</screen>

<para>If there are no errors, you can check or test the result. If
everything works fine, you can lock at your changes again.</para>

<screen>git diff</screen>

<para>The git-diff utility performs a line-by-line comparison of the
files against the latest version in you local repository. Try to only
make changes that have an impact on the generated files. Do not change
indentation or line wrapping of paragraphs unless absolutely
necessary. These kinds of changes increase the size of diff files and
make it much harder to evaluate the patches.  When making changes to
the program code, please use exactly the same coding style. If your
contribution is large enough to justify a copyright claim, please
indicate what copyright you claim in the patch. For modifications to
existing files, we will assume that your contribution falls under the
same license as the modified file. All new files will need to contain
a license declaration, preferably GPL version 2. In any case, the
license must be an <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses">OSI
accepted license</ulink> and be compatible with the rest of the
project.</para>

<para>Review all changes carefully. In case you have created new
source files, you need to register them with your repository.</para>

<screen>git add FILENAME</screen>

<para>If you think you are done, you can commit your changes to your local
repository.</para>

<screen>git commit -a</screen>

<para>Whenever you have made a certain change or added a certain
feature, you should commit your changes to your local repository. This
keeps patches small and makes reviewing them easier. The easier your
patches can be reviewed, the more likely they will get in.</para>

<para>The final step to submit your changes is to package them up and
sign them. It is always a good idea to check for upstream changes
again.</para>

<screen>git pull</screen>

<para>This makes sure you are really committing your patches against
the latest version of the source code. In case there were upstream
changes, you need to merge them first. Usually git does this
automatically. Refer to the <ulink
url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">git
manual</ulink> for details on resolving conflicts during merges. Now
you can create the patch or patch-set.</para>

<screen>git format-patch -s origin</screen>

<para>This will generate a number of files starting with 5-digit file
names. You then need to attach these files to a posting in the
<ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2/index.php?t=thread&amp;frm_id=5">TaskJuggler
Developer Forum</ulink>.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="contributing_translations"><title>Contributing Translations</title>

<para>Another possible area of contribution are translations of
TaskJuggler into languages other than US-English. Our development
process is in principle prepared for translations, but the first
translation will definitely be a bit difficult to do. TaskJuggler has
several hundred messages and more than two hundred pages of documentation.
Any translation is a significant effort and an ongoing commitment.
TaskJuggler is still actively developed and this will require the
translations to be updated as well. Please understand that we do not
want to ship partial or outdated translations to our users,
so please ensure you or a group of people are willing to maintain the
translations.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="some_final_words_to_contributors"><title>Some final words
to Contributors</title>

<para>We do welcome all contributions, but please understand that we
reserve the right to reject any contribution that does not follow the
above guidelines or otherwise conflicts with the goals of the
TaskJuggler team. It is a good idea to contact the team prior to
making any larger efforts.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="the_taskjuggler_components"><title>The TaskJuggler
Components</title>

<para>TaskJuggler consists of several modular components that you
may or may not need. TaskJuggler also uses some additional tools. We
have avoided to re-invent the wheel wherever possible.
We tried to keep the dependency list reasonably small, but it
nevertheless can be challenging for an inexperienced user to build
and install TaskJuggler from source code. Most users are probably
better served by using binary packages from their distributor. Almost
every mainstream 
distribution has TaskJuggler included in recent versions of their
product. If not, you might like to contact them to inform them that
they are missing an essential package.</para>

<para>This version of TaskJuggler was built and tested on SuSE Linux
10.0 and 10.1 on various hardware platforms.</para>

<sect2 id="the_graphical_use_interface"><title>The Graphical User
Interfaces</title>

<para>With version 2.2 came a new graphical front-end. It's an integrated
project management environment.</para>

<para>The front-end is called
<computeroutput>TaskJugglerUI</computeroutput>.
Don't confuse this with <computeroutput>taskjuggler</computeroutput>,
which is the commandline version. When you want to start TaskJugglerUI
from a shell, you need to type it with the capital letters.</para>

<para>The graphical front-end makes use of the libraries of the <ulink
url="http://www.kde.org">K Desktop Environment</ulink>. We recommend to use
at least version 3.4. Earlier versions will probably work as well, but
we have not tested them.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="the_command_line_tool_taskjuggler"><title>The command line
tool taskjuggler</title>

<para>To build and run TaskJuggler, you need:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>Qt &mdash; The <ulink

version 3.3 or higher</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> GNU Compiler Collection &mdash; We are currently
using GCC 4.0 to develop TaskJuggler. Since we try to write the code
platform independent and ANSI standard compliant it should work with
most other compilers as well.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para>The requirements listed are enough to build and use the command line
program that translates project descriptions into HTML or XML reports.
If you want to build this documentation or use the tools to process
the XML files you need to install the additional dependencies. If any
of the following dependencies are not matched, the configure script
will issue a warning but will not fail.</para>

<sect2 id="contributed_stuff"><title>Contributed Stuff</title>

<para>Several people have contributed useful tools for TaskJuggler
users. These tools can be found in the Contrib directory of the source
code package. Please refer to the included README files for
installation information.</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="compilation_and_installation"><title>Compilation and
Installation</title> <para>
Before compiling TaskJuggler you need to set the
<computeroutput>QTDIR</computeroutput> environment variable to the
base directory of your Qt version. This is normally
<computeroutput>/usr/lib64/qt3</computeroutput> or
<computeroutput>/usr/lib/qt3</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>To compile and install TaskJuggler on your system, type the following 
in the base directory of the TaskJuggler distribution:</para>

<para><screen>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</screen></para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler uses <computeroutput>autoconf</computeroutput>, you
should have no trouble compiling it. TaskJuggler has some weak or
non-mandatory dependencies. If any of these are not satisfied, a
warning is issued. In case a mandatory dependency is not found, an
error is displayed and the configuration program stops. If you have
problems, please report them to the TaskJuggler user forum at
<ulink url="http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2">
http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2</ulink> in English. Someone
there can help you out.</para>

<para>In case you want to build TaskJuggler without the graphical
front-end, you can disable it during the configuration process:</para>

<para><screen>
% ./configure --with-kde-support=no --prefix=/usr/local
% make
% make install
</screen></para>

</sect1>
</chapter> 
<chapter id="usage"><title>Usage</title> 
<sect1 id="basics"><title>Basics</title>

<para>TaskJuggler uses one or more text files to describe a project.
The main project should be placed in a file with the
<computeroutput>.tjp</computeroutput> extension. This main project may
contain several sub-projects. Such sub-projects should be placed in
files with the <computeroutput>.tji</computeroutput> extension. These
sub-projects are included in the main project during compile
time.</para>

<para>When TaskJuggler is used with other tools, the project
description or the reports may also be in XML format. The recommended
extension for such files is
<computeroutput>.tjx</computeroutput>.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1 id="general_usage"><title>General Usage</title>

<para>To use the graphical front-end simply start it from the menu.
Depending on your Linux Distribution you will usually find it under
Office/Project Management or a similar entry. To start it from a shell

<para><screen>
% TaskJugglerUI
</screen> </para>

<para>The commandline version of TaskJuggler works like a compiler.
You provide the source files, it computes the contents and creates the
output files.</para>

<para>Let's say you have a project file called
<filename>AcSo.tjp</filename>. It contains the tasks of your project
and their dependencies. To schedule the project and create report
files you have to ask TaskJuggler to process it.</para>

<para><screen>
% taskjuggler AcSo.tjp
</screen> </para>

<para>TaskJuggler will try to schedule all tasks with the specified
conditions and generate the reports that were requested with the <link
linkend="PROPERTY_htmltaskreport">htmltaskreport</link>, <link
linkend="PROPERTY_htmlresourcereport">htmlresourcereport</link> or other report
properties in the input file.</para>

<para>In contrast to the commandline version the GUI does not generate
all reports directly after scheduling. Only the report that was
visible previously will be generated. All other reports including export
reports will be generated when viewed or requested by the right mouse
button menu.</para>

<para>Are you also frustrated by tools that can't read the data of
their earlier incarnations? After all, those files contain your
valuable data and the first impression of the wonderful new version
is its failure to read your old files. With TaskJuggler we
like to spare you such situations as much as possible. But TaskJuggler
1.x was written to solve the problems that we encountered. By
releasing it to the general public we learned that TaskJuggler is also
very useful to many other people. Some contacted us to tell us that
it would be even more useful to them, if TaskJuggler could have this
or that new feature. In many cases we added these new features but we
learned more and more that some parts of the original TaskJuggler
design were not flexible enough to support some new features. For
TaskJuggler 2.x we decided to change TaskJuggler to a more flexible
design even if this meant that some syntax constructs would no longer
be supported.</para>

<para>As TaskJuggler uses plain text file as its main data format,
you will always be able to read in your old files. But in some
cases, you need to change certain syntax constructs to the new syntax.
When TaskJuggler processes a file with deprecated syntax it will
generate an error message. This usually contains a hint, how the
statement should look like in the new syntax. The following sections
discuss the conceptual changes and what statements need to be
changed.</para>

<sect2 id="syntax_changes"><title>Syntax changes</title>

<para>TaskJugger 1.x could only handle two scenarios with the fixed
name <computeroutput>plan</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>actual</computeroutput>. TaskJuggler 2.0 can now
handle any number of scenarios. Scenario specific task attributes have
to be prefixed with the scenario ID followed by a colon. The
attributes starting with 'plan' or 'actual' have been
deprecated.</para>

<para>HTML reports are now a lot more flexible. New CSS
elements are used and the table elements are customizable now.
Old stylesheets will no longer work, since the attribute names have
changed. An HTML report contains CSS attribute class specifications if
you provide a custom stylesheet definition with <link
linkend="PROPERTY_rawstylesheet">rawstylesheet</link>.</para>

<para>The scenario name is no longer displayed by default if
more than one scenario is included in a report. A column
<computeroutput>scenario</computeroutput> must be explicitly added if
the scenario name should be reported for each line. The attributes
'showactual' and 'hideplan' have been deprecated. The <link
linkend="PROPERTY_scenarios">scenarios</link> attribute now
controls which scenarios should be shown.</para>

<para>The format of numbers and currency values can now be
specified with <link
linkend="PROPERTY_numberformat">numberformat</link> and <link
linkend="PROPERTY_currencyformat">currencyformat</link>. The old
keyword currencydigits has been deprecated.</para>

<para><link
linkend="PROPERTY_workinghours">workinghours</link> and <link
linkend="PROPERTY_currency">currency</link> are no longer global
properties. They are now optional attributes of the project
property.</para>

<para>Container tasks in export reports no longer have fixed
start and end dates, if they have their subtasks exported as
well.</para>

<para>The functions for <link
linkend="TYPE_LOGICALEXPRESSION">Logical Expressions</link> are now using
capital letters to improve their readability. The all lowercase
versions are still supported, but the recommended versions are now the
ones with intermixed uppercase letters.
<computeroutput>isTaskOfProject</computeroutput> was added as new
query function.</para>

<para>Support for a new XML format has been added. The old format is still
supported. TaskJuggler can read both old and new format XML files but will
use the new XML format for output.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="scheduler_changes"><title>Scheduler changes</title>

<para>Length and duration tasks with resource
allocations are no longer trimmed to the first and last resource
allocation. This can lead to different schedules.</para>

<para>'length' based tasks now use the global working hours
and global vacation settings as a criteria of what is a working day.
The tasks now always end during working hours and not at
midnight.</para>

<para>The maximum allocation of a resource for a task is no
longer limited by default. <link
linkend="PROPERTY_maxeffort">maxeffort</link> now defaults to 0
(unlimited) instead of 1.0 (8 hours per day). To have the same
behaviour as in TaskJuggler 1.x, you need to specify
<computeroutput>maxeffort 1.0</computeroutput> before any resource

<para>Q: Why does taskjuggler use Qt when it's not an X11
application?</para>
<para>A: Qt is a very powerful library that is much more than just a
widget library. TaskJuggler uses Qt for all kinds of internal data
types like lists and arrays. It also uses the Unicode functions, the
SQL database interface and the XML support of Qt.</para>

<para>Q: Can TaskJuggler be compiled and used on Windows?</para>
<para>A: Probably yes, but we have never tried it. It should compile
but may require some minor tweaks of the source. You should have
good knowledge of C++ and Qt when you try this. Please let us know if you
were successful.</para>
