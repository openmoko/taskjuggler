<para>
This document describes TaskJuggler version @VERSION@
</para>

<para>The <application>TaskJuggler</application> manual consists of
two parts. The first part contains general usage information and a
tutorial. The tutorial is highly recommended for all first-time
TaskJuggler users. It is a very good introduction to many TaskJuggler
concepts and features. The second part is the language
reference.</para>

<chapter><title>Introduction</title>
<sect1><title>About TaskJuggler</title>

<para>TaskJuggler is a project planing tool for Linux and UNIX
system-based operating systems. Whether you want to build a skyscraper
or plan your colleagues shifts for the next month - TaskJuggler
is the tool for you.</para>

<para>Instead of clicking yourself painfully through hundreds of
dialog boxes you specify your TaskJuggler project in a simple text
format.  You write down all your tasks with their dependencies and
other properties using your favorit text editor. The information is
then sent through the TaskJuggler program and you will get all sorts
of reports in HTML or XML format. The HTML files can be viewed and
printed with any web browser that supports Cascading Style Sheets.
JavaScript support is recommended. The XML files are used by the
Gantt- and PERT chart generators and the <ulink
url="http://www.kde.org">KDE</ulink> <ulink
url="http://konqueror.kde.org">Konqueror</ulink> plug-in.</para>

<para>TaskJuggler does not only honor the task interdependencies but
also takes resource constrains and prioritization into account. Using
TaskJugglers powerful filtering and reporting algorithms you can
create a variety of task lists, resource usage tables, status reports,
project calendars and project accounting statements.</para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler is not constrained by the performance requirements
of real-time editing it can offer a much broader set of features not
found in any of the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) project
planing tools. The the project description language is easy to learn
and supports you very effectively during your planing and tracking
process.</para>

http://www.taskjuggler.org</ulink>.</para>

<para> Since the developers are mostly busy project managers
themselves, we have created two forums for users to help each other.
</para>

<para>The TaskJuggler user mailing list is hosted by <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/en">SuSE</ulink>. You can subscribe and
unsubscribe at <ulink url="http://www.suse.de/en/support/mailinglists">

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Requirements</title>

<para>TaskJuggler uses many additional tools. We have avoided to
re-invent the wheel again wherever possible, at the same time we tried
to keep the dependency list reasonably small. Nevertheless can it be
challenging to the unexperienced user to build and install TaskJuggler
from source code. Most users are probably better served by using
binary packages from their distributor. Some distributions even have
TaskJuggler included like the <ulink
url="http://www.suse.de/en">SuSE</ulink> distribution.</para>

<para>This version of TaskJuggler was built and tested on SuSE Linux
8.2 and 9.0 on various hardware platforms.</para>

<sect2><title>The command line tool taskjuggler</title>

<para>To build and run TaskJuggler, you need:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>qt3.1 &mdash; The <ulink

version 3.1 or higher</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> GNU Compiler Collection &mdash; We are currently
using GCC 3.2 to develop TaskJuggler. Since we try to write the code
platform independent and ANSI standard compliant it should work with
other compilers as well.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para>These requirements are enough to build and use the command line
program that translates project descriptions into HTML or XML reports.
If you want to built this documentation or use the tools to process
the XML files you need to take care of additional dependencies. If any
of the following dependencies are not matched, the configure script
will issue a warning but will not fail.</para>

<sect2><title>Contributed Stuff</title>

<para>Serveral people have contributed useful tools for TaskJuggler
users. These tools can be found in the Contrib directory of the source
code package. Please refer to the included README files for
installation information.</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Compilation and Installation</title>
<para>
Before compiling TaskJuggler you need to set the
<computeroutput>QTDIR</computeroutput> environment variable to the
base directory of your Qt version. This is normally
<computeroutput>/usr/lib/qt3</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>To compile and install TaskJuggler on your system, type the following 
in the base directory of the TaskJuggler distribution:</para>

<para><screen>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</screen></para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler uses <computeroutput>autoconf</computeroutput>, you
should have no trouble compiling it. TaskJugger has some weak or
non-mandatory dependencies. If any of there are not satisfied, a
warning is issued. In case a mandatory dependency is not found, an
error is displayed and the configuration program stops. If you have
problems, please report them to the TaskJuggler mailing
list at <ulink url="mailto:taskjuggler@suse.com">
taskjuggler@suse.com</ulink> in English. Maybe someone there can help
you out.</para>

</sect1>
</chapter> 
<chapter><title>Usage</title> 
<sect1><title>Basics</title>

<para>TaskJuggler uses one or more text files to describe a project.
The main project should be placed in a file with the
<computeroutput>.tjp</computeroutput> extension. This main project may
contain several sub-projects. Such sub-projects should be placed in
files with the <computeroutput>.tji</computeroutput> extension. These
sub-projects are included in the main project during compile
time.</para>

<para>When TaskJuggler is used with other tools the project
description or the reports may also be in XML format. The recommended
extension for such files is
<computeroutput>.tjx</computeroutput>.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1><title> General Usage</title>

<para>TaskJuggler works like a compiler. You provide the source
files, it computes the contents and creates the output files.</para>

<para>Let's say you have a project file called
<filename>AcSo.tjp</filename>. It contains the tasks of your project
and their dependencies. To schedule the project and create report
files you have to ask TaskJuggler to process it.</para>

<para><screen>
% taskjuggler AcSo.tjp
</screen> </para>

<para>TaskJuggler will try to schedule all tasks with the specified
conditions and generate the reports that were requested with the <link
linkend="PROPERTY_htmltaskreport">htmltaskreport</link>, <link
linkend="PROPERTY_htmlresourcereport">htmlresourcereport</link> or other report
properties in the input file.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1><title> The Command Line Options</title>

<para><simplelist type="horiz" columns="2">

<member>--help</member>
<member>Print all command line options with a short
description.</member>

<member>--version</member>
<member>Print the version and copyright info.</member>

<member>-v</member><member>Same as '--version'.</member>

<member>-s</member><member>Stop TaskJuggler run after syntax check.
This option is for testing and debugging purposes only.</member>

<member>-M</member><member>Output fragment of a Makefile that lists
the dependencies of the passed TaskJuggler files.</member>

<member>--makefile &lt;file&gt;</member><member>Similar to '-M' but write

<member>--maxerrors N</member><member>Specifies the number of errors
after which TaskJuggler stops checking the input files. If N is 0
all errors are displayed.</member>

<member>--nodepcheck</member>
<member>Do not check for dependency loops. The loop detector uses an
algorithm that needs exponentially more time the bigger the dependency
network gets. So for large projects it can be desireable to skip the
dependency loop detection. This does not affect the task scheduling
but can lead to error messages that are difficult to associate with a
flawed dependency specification.</member>

<member>--debug N</member>
<member>Print debug output, N must be between 0 and 4, the higher N
the more output is printed. This option is for testing and debugging
purposes only.</member>

<member>--dbmode N</member>
<member>Limit debug output to certain modules of the code. N is a bit
mask. Each set bit actives output of a certain module. Currently the
following modules are supported: Project File Reader (1), Project
Scheduler (2), Task Scheduler (4), Resource Scheduler (8), Expression
Tree Evaluator (16). This option is for testing and debugging purposes
only.</member>

<member>--updatedb</member>
<member>Update the Kotrus database with the new resource usage
information.</member>

</simplelist></para>

<para>Calling TaskJuggler with . as input filename will cause reading
from stdin. To redirect output to stdout you can specify -- as
filename for reports. This feature can for example be used to generate
dynamic HTML pages from CGI scripts.</para>

<sect1><title> Reporting Bugs and Sending Feedback</title>

<para>All official releases of TaskJuggler are meant to be stable
releases unless explicitly noted differently. But our test suite is
still very small and some features cannot be tested automatically very
well. So it's very likely that your current version of TaskJuggler
contains some bugs. If you find a bug please follow this
procedure:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>Read this manual to make sure that it is actually a
bug and not a feature.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Check the TaskJuggler <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org">web page</ulink>.
Possibly the bug was already found and a patch or workaround
exists.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Try to create a test project that is as small as
possible but still reproduces the bug.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Send the test project and a detailed description of

<chapter><title>Migrating from TaskJuggler 1.x to 2.0</title>

<sect1><title>Achiving compatibility</title>

<para>Are you also frustrated by tools that can't read the data of
their earlier incarnations? After all those files contain your
valuable data and the first impression that the wonderful new version
makes is it's rejection to read your old files. With TaskJuggler we
like to spare you such situations as much as possible. But TaskJuggler
1.x has been written to solve the problems that we encountered. By
releasing it to the general public we learned that TaskJuggler is also
very usefull to many other people. Some contacted us to tell us that
it would be even more usefull to them, if TaskJuggler would have this
or that new feature. In many cases we added these new features but we
learned more and more that some parts of the original TaskJuggler
design were not flexible enough to support some new features. For
TaskJuggler 2.x we decided to change TaskJuggler to a more flexible
design even if this meant that some syntax constructs could no longer
be supported.</para>

<para>As TaskJuggler uses plain text file as its main data format,
you will always to able to read in your old files. But in some
cases, you need to change certain syntax constructs to the syntax.
When TaskJuggler processes a file with deprecated syntax it will
generate an error message. This usually contains a hint, how the
statement should look like in new syntax. The following sections
discuss the conceptual changes and what statements need to be
changed.</para>

<sect2><title>Syntax changes</title>

<para>TaskJugger 1.x could only handle two scenarios with the fixed
name <computeroutput>plan</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>actual</computeroutput>. TaskJuggler 2.0 can now
handle any number of scenarios. Scenario specific task attributes have
to be prefixed with the scenario ID followed by a colon. The
attributes starting with 'plan' or 'actual' have been
deprecated.</para>

<para>HTML reports are now a lot more flexible. New CSS
elements have being used and the table elements are customizable now.
Old stylesheets will no longer work, since the attribute names have
changed. A HTML report contains CSS attribute class specification if
you provide a custom stylesheet definition with <link
linkend="PROPERTY_rawstylesheet">rawstylesheet</link>.</para>

<para>The scenario name is no longer displayed by default if
more than one scenario is included in a report. A column
<computeroutput>scenario</computeroutput> must be explicitly added if
the scenario name should be reported for each line. The attributes
'showactual' and 'hideplan' have been deprecated. The <link
linkend="PROPERTY_scenarios">scenarios</link> attribute now
controls which scenarios should be shown.</para>

<para>The format of numbers and currency values can now be
specified with <link
linkend="PROPERTY_numberformat">numberformat</link> and <link
linkend="PROPERTY_currencyformat">currencyformat</link>. The old
keyword currencydigits has been deprecated.</para>

<para><link
linkend="PROPERTY_workinghours">workinghours</link> and <link
linkend="PROPERTY_currency">currency</link> are no longer global
properties. They are now optional attributes of the project
property.</para>

<para>Container tasks in export reports no longer have fixed
start and end date if they have their sub tasks exported as
well.</para>

<para>The functions for <link
linkend="TYPE_LOGICALEXPRESSION">Logical Expressions</link> are now using
capital letters to improve their readability. The all lowercase
versions are still supported, but the recommended versions are now the
ones with intermixed uppercase letters.
<computeroutput>isTaskOfProject</computeroutput> was added as new
query function.</para>

<para>Support for new XML format has been added. The old
format is still supported. TJ can read both old and new format XML
files but will use the new XML format for output.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Scheduler changes</title>

<para>Length and duration tasks with resource
allocations are no longer trimmed to the first and last resource
allocation. This can lead to different schedules.</para>

<para>'length' based task now use the global working hours
and global vacation settings as a criteria of what is a working day.
The tasks now always end during working hours and not at
midnight.</para>

<para>The maximum allocation of a resource for a task is no
longer limited by default. <link
linkend="PROPERTY_maxeffort">maxeffort</link> now defaults to 0
(unlimited) instead of 1.0 (8 hours per day). To have the same
behaviour as in TaskJuggler 1.x version you need to specify
<computeroutput>maxeffort 1.0</computeroutput> before any resource
definition. This change was made since many users were confused when
after increasing the daily working hours resources were still only
allocated 8 hours per day.</para>

<chapter><title>Questions and Answers</title>
<sect1><title>General Questions</title>

<para>Q: Why does taskjuggler use Qt when it's not an X11
application?</para>
<para>A: Qt is a very powerfull library that is much more than just a
widget library. TaskJuggler uses Qt for all kinds of internal data
types like lists and arrays. It also uses the Unicode functions, the
SQL database interface and the XML support of Qt.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Compiling and installation</title>

<para>Q: Can TaskJuggler be compiled and used on Windows?</para>
<para>A: Probably yes, but we have never tried it. It should compile
but require possible some minor tweaks of the sources. You should have
a good knowledge of C++ and Qt when you try this. Let us know if you
were successfull.</para>
