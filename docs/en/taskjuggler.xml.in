This document describes TaskJuggler version @VERSION@
</para>

<para>The <application>TaskJuggler</application> manual consists of
two parts. The first part contains general usage information and a
tutorial. The tutorial is highly recommended for all first-time
TaskJuggler users. It is a very good introduction to many TaskJuggler
concepts and features. The second part is the language
reference.</para>

<chapter id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<sect1 id="about_taskjuggler"><title>About TaskJuggler</title>

<para>TaskJuggler is a project planing tool for Linux and UNIX
system-based operating systems. Whether you want to build a skyscraper
or plan your colleagues shifts for the next month - TaskJuggler
is the tool for you.</para>

<para>Instead of clicking yourself painfully through hundreds of
dialog boxes you specify your TaskJuggler project in a simple text
format.  You write down all your tasks with their dependencies and
other properties using the graphical front-end or your favorit text
editor. The information is processed by the TaskJuggler program
and you will get all sorts of reports in an interactive format or as
HTML or XML format. The HTML files can be viewed and printed with any
web browser that supports Cascading Style Sheets.  JavaScript support
is recommended. The XML files are used by the Gantt- and PERT chart
generators and the <ulink url="http://www.kde.org">KDE</ulink> <ulink
url="http://konqueror.kde.org">Konqueror</ulink> plug-in.</para>

<para>TaskJuggler does not only honor the task interdependencies but
also takes resource constrains and prioritization into account. Using
TaskJugglers powerful filtering and reporting algorithms you can
create a variety of task lists, resource usage tables, status reports,
project calendars and project accounting statements.</para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler is not constrained by the performance requirements
of real-time editing it can offer a much broader set of features not
found in any of the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) project
planing tools. The the project description language is easy to learn
and supports you very effectively during your planing and tracking
process.</para>

<para>The official TaskJuggler web site can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org">
http://www.taskjuggler.org</ulink>.</para>

<para>Since the developers are mostly busy project managers
themselves, we have created a <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2">forum</ulink> for users to
help each other.</para>

<para>The TaskJuggler project has been sponsored by SUSE for several
years. After the aquistion by <ulink

kindly host our web presence and our <ulink

<sect1 id="how_to_contribute"><title>How to Contribute</title>

<sect2 id="why_contribute"><title>Why contribute?</title>

<para>TaskJuggler is an Open Source Project. It was developed by
volunteers mostly in their spare time. Made available under the GNU
General Public license and similar licenses, TaskJuggler can be shared
and used free of charge by anybody who respects the license
conditions. Does that mean you can use it without worrying about
anything? Clearly not! Though users have no legal obligation to
contribute, you should feel a moral obligation to support Open Source
in whatever way you can. This can range from helping out other
users with their first Linux installation to actively contributing to
the TaskJuggler Project. The following section describes, how you can
contribute to any of the components that are part of the TaskJuggler
software releases.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="preparing_a_contribution"><title>Preparing a
contribution</title>

<para>To get started you need to download the most current development
snapshot from the <ulink
url="http://www.taskjuggler.org/download.php">TaskJuggler Download
Site</ulink>. The development snapshot is updated once a day to
provide access to the continous development. It is important that you
use a very recent snapshot as the developers might have made changes
in the same files as you. This increases the chance for change
collisions which can ultimately lead to the rejection of your
contribution.</para>

<para>Unpack the tarball as described in the installation section.
Then rename the taskjuggler directory to something like
<varname>taskjuggler-yourname</varname>. Then unpack the tarball again
in the same place as before. You should now have a directory that
contains two identical directory trees, each with a slightly different
name of the top-level directoy of each tree.</para>

<para>Next you need to find the files where you want to make your
modifications. Please make your changes only in the
<varname>taskjuggler-yourname</varname> directory. The other directory
must be left unmodified. We need it later on to create a file that
just contains your changes. Sometimes files will be generated from
other files. Do not change those generated files. Your changes will be
overwritten the next time you call the make utility. To identify those
files, some familiarity with make and other Linux tools are
helpful. Whenever there is a file with the same base name and the extension
<varname>.in</varname> in the same directory, then the file is
generated from the <varname>.in</varname>-file. You need to modify the
<varname>.in</varname>-file, not the one with just the base
name. Another indicator is the fact that the file is not part of the
tarball. With few exceptions that can be identified by the .in-file rule
above, the tarball does not contain any generated files.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="creating_a_patch"><title>Creating a Patch</title>

<para>When you are done with your changes, it's a good idea to test them.
Type

<screen>make</screen>

in the <varname>taskjuggler-yourname</varname> directory. In case
there are no errors, you can inspect the result. In case everything
builds fine, you can remove all generated files again by typing 

<screen>make distclean</screen>

Now you can generate a file that just contains
your modifications by typing
<screen>diff -ru taskjuggler-svn taskjuggler-yourname > taskjuggler-yourname.diff</screen>

Inspect the generated file
<varname>taskjuggler-yourname.diff</varname> and make sure it only
contains diffs for files that you have changed and the changes are the
way you want them to be. In case there are generated files included as
well, please remove those files and regenerate the diff.</para>

<para>As you can see, the diff utility performs a line-by-line
comparisons of the files. Therefor make sure, you only make changes
that have an impact on the generated files. Do you change indentation
or line wrapping of paragraphs. These kind of changes increase the
size of diff files and make it much harder to evaluate the patches.
When making changes to the program code, please use our coding
style. In case your contribution is large enough to justify a
copyright claim, please indicate this in the patch. For modifications
to existing files, we assume that your contribution falls under the
same license as the modified file. All new files need to contain a
license declaration.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="contributing_translations"><title>Contributing Translations</title>

<para>Another possible area of contribution are translation of
TaskJuggler into languages other than US english. Our development
process is in pricinple prepared for translations, but the first
translation will definitely be a bit bumpy to include. TaskJuggler has
several hunderd messages and more than hundred pages of documentation.
Any translation is a significant effort and an ongoing commitment.
TaskJuggler is still actively developed and this requires the
translations to be updated as well. Please understand that we do not
want to ship partial or outdated translations to our users.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="some_final_words_to_contributors"><title>Some final words
to Contributors</title>

<para>We do welcome all contributions but please understand that we
reseve the right to reject any contribution that does not follow the
above guidelines or otherwise conflicts with the goals of the
TaskJuggler team. It is a good idea to contact the team prior to
making any larger efforts.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="the_taskjuggler_components"><title>The TaskJuggler
Components</title>

<para>TaskJuggler consists of several modular components that you
might need or not. TaskJuggler also uses some additional tools. We
have avoided to re-invent the wheel again wherever possible, at the
same time we tried to keep the dependency list reasonably small.
Nevertheless can it be challenging to the unexperienced user to build
and install TaskJuggler from source code. Most users are probably
better served by using binary packages from their distributor. Almost
every mainstream 
distribution has TaskJuggler included in recent version of their
product. If not, you might like to contact them to inform them that
they are missing an essential package.</para>

<para>This version of TaskJuggler was built and tested on SuSE Linux
9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 on various hardware platforms.</para>

<sect2 id="the_graphical_use_interface"><title>The Graphical User
Interfaces</title>

<para>With version 2.1 came a new graphical front-end. It's an integrated
Project management environment.</para>

<para>The front-end is called
<computeroutput>TaskJugglerUI</computeroutput>.
Don't confuse this with <computeroutput>taskjuggler</computeroutput>
which is the commandline version. When you want to start TaskJugglerUI
from a shell, you need to type it with the capital letters.</para>

<para>The graphical front-ends make use of the libraries of the <ulink
url="www.kde.org">K Desktop Environment</ulink>. We recommend to use
at least version 3.4. Earlier version will probably work as well, but
we have not tested them.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="the_command_line_tool_taskjuggler"><title>The command line
tool taskjuggler</title>

<para>To build and run TaskJuggler, you need:</para>

<para><itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>Qt &mdash; The <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source"> Qt C++ class library</ulink>
version 3.3 or higher</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> GNU Compiler Collection &mdash; We are currently
using GCC 3.2 to develop TaskJuggler. Since we try to write the code
platform independent and ANSI standard compliant it should work with
other compilers as well.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist></para>

<para>These requirements are enough to build and use the command line
program that translates project descriptions into HTML or XML reports.
If you want to built this documentation or use the tools to process
the XML files you need to take care of additional dependencies. If any
of the following dependencies are not matched, the configure script
will issue a warning but will not fail.</para>

<para>Serveral people have contributed useful tools for TaskJuggler
users. These tools can be found in the Contrib directory of the source
code package. Please refer to the included README files for
installation information.</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="compilation_and_installation"><title>Compilation and
Installation</title> <para>
Before compiling TaskJuggler you need to set the
<computeroutput>QTDIR</computeroutput> environment variable to the
base directory of your Qt version. This is normally
<computeroutput>/usr/lib/qt3</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>To compile and install TaskJuggler on your system, type the following 
in the base directory of the TaskJuggler distribution:</para>

<para><screen>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</screen></para>

<para>Since TaskJuggler uses <computeroutput>autoconf</computeroutput>, you
should have no trouble compiling it. TaskJugger has some weak or
non-mandatory dependencies. If any of there are not satisfied, a
warning is issued. In case a mandatory dependency is not found, an
error is displayed and the configuration program stops. If you have
problems, please report them to the TaskJuggler user forum at
<ulink url="http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2">
http://www.taskjuggler.org/FUDforum2</ulink> in English. Maybe someone
there can help you out.</para>

<para>In case you want to build TaskJuggler without the graphical
front-ends, you can disable them during them configuration
process:</para>

<para><screen>
% ./configure --with-kde-support=no --prefix=/usr/local
% make
% make install
</screen></para>

</chapter> 
<chapter id="usage"><title>Usage</title> 
<sect1 id="basics"><title>Basics</title>

<para>TaskJuggler uses one or more text files to describe a project.
The main project should be placed in a file with the
<computeroutput>.tjp</computeroutput> extension. This main project may
contain several sub-projects. Such sub-projects should be placed in
files with the <computeroutput>.tji</computeroutput> extension. These
sub-projects are included in the main project during compile
time.</para>

<para>When TaskJuggler is used with other tools the project
description or the reports may also be in XML format. The recommended
extension for such files is
<computeroutput>.tjx</computeroutput>.</para>

</sect1> 
<sect1 id="general_usage"><title>General Usage</title>

<para>To use the graphical front-end simply start it from the menu.
Depeding on your Linux Distribution you will usually find it under
Office/Project Management or a similar entry. To start it from a shell
type</para>

<para><screen>
% TaskJugglerUI
</screen> </para>

<para>The commandline version of TaskJuggler works like a compiler.
You provide the source files, it computes the contents and creates the
output files.</para>

<para>Let's say you have a project file called
<filename>AcSo.tjp</filename>. It contains the tasks of your project
and their dependencies. To schedule the project and create report
files you have to ask TaskJuggler to process it.</para>

<para><screen>
% taskjuggler AcSo.tjp
</screen> </para>

<para>TaskJuggler will try to schedule all tasks with the specified
conditions and generate the reports that were requested with the <link
linkend="PROPERTY_htmltaskreport">htmltaskreport</link>, <link
linkend="PROPERTY_htmlresourcereport">htmlresourcereport</link> or other report
properties in the input file.</para>

<para>Are you also frustrated by tools that can't read the data of
their earlier incarnations? After all those files contain your
valuable data and the first impression that the wonderful new version
makes is it's rejection to read your old files. With TaskJuggler we
like to spare you such situations as much as possible. But TaskJuggler
1.x has been written to solve the problems that we encountered. By
releasing it to the general public we learned that TaskJuggler is also
very usefull to many other people. Some contacted us to tell us that
it would be even more usefull to them, if TaskJuggler would have this
or that new feature. In many cases we added these new features but we
learned more and more that some parts of the original TaskJuggler
design were not flexible enough to support some new features. For
TaskJuggler 2.x we decided to change TaskJuggler to a more flexible
design even if this meant that some syntax constructs could no longer
be supported.</para>

<para>As TaskJuggler uses plain text file as its main data format,
you will always to able to read in your old files. But in some
cases, you need to change certain syntax constructs to the syntax.
When TaskJuggler processes a file with deprecated syntax it will
generate an error message. This usually contains a hint, how the
statement should look like in new syntax. The following sections
discuss the conceptual changes and what statements need to be
changed.</para>

<sect2 id="syntax_changes"><title>Syntax changes</title>

<para>TaskJugger 1.x could only handle two scenarios with the fixed
name <computeroutput>plan</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>actual</computeroutput>. TaskJuggler 2.0 can now
handle any number of scenarios. Scenario specific task attributes have
to be prefixed with the scenario ID followed by a colon. The
attributes starting with 'plan' or 'actual' have been
deprecated.</para>

<para>HTML reports are now a lot more flexible. New CSS
elements have being used and the table elements are customizable now.
Old stylesheets will no longer work, since the attribute names have
changed. A HTML report contains CSS attribute class specification if
you provide a custom stylesheet definition with <link
linkend="PROPERTY_rawstylesheet">rawstylesheet</link>.</para>

<para>The scenario name is no longer displayed by default if
more than one scenario is included in a report. A column
<computeroutput>scenario</computeroutput> must be explicitly added if
the scenario name should be reported for each line. The attributes
'showactual' and 'hideplan' have been deprecated. The <link
linkend="PROPERTY_scenarios">scenarios</link> attribute now
controls which scenarios should be shown.</para>

<para>The format of numbers and currency values can now be
specified with <link
linkend="PROPERTY_numberformat">numberformat</link> and <link
linkend="PROPERTY_currencyformat">currencyformat</link>. The old
keyword currencydigits has been deprecated.</para>

<para><link
linkend="PROPERTY_workinghours">workinghours</link> and <link
linkend="PROPERTY_currency">currency</link> are no longer global
properties. They are now optional attributes of the project
property.</para>

<para>Container tasks in export reports no longer have fixed
start and end date if they have their sub tasks exported as
well.</para>

<para>The functions for <link
linkend="TYPE_LOGICALEXPRESSION">Logical Expressions</link> are now using
capital letters to improve their readability. The all lowercase
versions are still supported, but the recommended versions are now the
ones with intermixed uppercase letters.
<computeroutput>isTaskOfProject</computeroutput> was added as new
query function.</para>

<para>Support for new XML format has been added. The old
format is still supported. TJ can read both old and new format XML
files but will use the new XML format for output.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="scheduler_changes"><title>Scheduler changes</title>

<para>Length and duration tasks with resource
allocations are no longer trimmed to the first and last resource
allocation. This can lead to different schedules.</para>

<para>'length' based task now use the global working hours
and global vacation settings as a criteria of what is a working day.
The tasks now always end during working hours and not at
midnight.</para>

<para>The maximum allocation of a resource for a task is no
longer limited by default. <link
linkend="PROPERTY_maxeffort">maxeffort</link> now defaults to 0
(unlimited) instead of 1.0 (8 hours per day). To have the same
behaviour as in TaskJuggler 1.x version you need to specify
<computeroutput>maxeffort 1.0</computeroutput> before any resource
definition. This change was made since many users were confused when
after increasing the daily working hours resources were still only
allocated 8 hours per day.</para>

<para>Q: Why does taskjuggler use Qt when it's not an X11
application?</para>
<para>A: Qt is a very powerfull library that is much more than just a
widget library. TaskJuggler uses Qt for all kinds of internal data
types like lists and arrays. It also uses the Unicode functions, the
SQL database interface and the XML support of Qt.</para>

<para>Q: Can TaskJuggler be compiled and used on Windows?</para>
<para>A: Probably yes, but we have never tried it. It should compile
but require possible some minor tweaks of the sources. You should have
a good knowledge of C++ and Qt when you try this. Let us know if you
were successfull.</para>
