<sect>Introduction
<p>
<sect1>About TaskJuggler
<p>

TaskJuggler is a project management tool for Linux and Unix operating
systems. Whether you want to plan your college's shifts for the next
month or want to build a skyscraper - TaskJuggler is the tool for you.

Instead of clicking yourself painfully through hundreds of dialog
boxes you specify your TaskJuggler project in a simple text format.
You simply list all your tasks and their dependencies. The information
is sent through TaskJuggler and you will get all sorts of reports in
HTML or XML format.

TaskJuggler does not only honor the task interdependencies but also
takes resource constrains into account. Using TaskJuggler's powerful
filtering and reporting algorithms you can create task lists, resource
usage tables, status reports, project calendars and project accounting
statements.

<p>

</itemize>

<sect1>TaskJuggler on the Web
<p>
The official TaskJuggler web page can be found at <htmlurl

<sect1>Changes

<sect2>Version 1.0.0 (2002-03-14)
<p>
<itemize>

<item>Initial stable public release

</itemize>

<sect2>Version 1.0.1 (2002-03-15)
<p>
<itemize>

<item>Fixed completely broken global vacation handling

<item>Added test case for vacation handling to test suite

</itemize>

<sect2>Version 1.1
<p>
<itemize>

<item> Added some reports to the example file, so users actually get a
result of the TaskJuggler run. 

<item> Support for later completion of task and resources added. By
writing 'supplement task &lt;ID&gt; { ... }' an already defined task
can be extended. So it's easier now to create a file which contains
the vacations for all resources separate from the resource definition
itself.

<item>Extended expression parser to work on string type values as well.

<item><ref name="Logical expressions" id="logicalexpression"> for
hidetask, rolluptask etc. can now contain functions as well. Currently
there is support for 'istask', 'isresource', 'isaccount',
'issubtaskof', 'contains', 'ismilestone'.

<item>Moved the docs directory from TaskJuggler subdir to topdir.

<item>Added feature list and change-log to the documentation.

<item><ref name="Property reference" id="reference"> is now sorted in
alphabetical order. 

<item>Added lots of missing attributes to <ref
name="htmlaccountreport" id="htmlaccountreport">.

<item>Added missing <ref name="export" id="export"> report to
documentation. Export reports can now contain the scheduled tasks as
well as the resource allocations.

<item>New keywords <tt/planbooking/ and <tt/actualbooking/ to enter
fixed bookings of <ref name="resources" id="resource"> in the resource
declaration.

<item>Added new example project to illustrate the use of export in big
projects that are split into sub projects.

<item>HTML comment in HTML report files is now using correct syntax.

<item>Partial fix for correct time zone handling.

<item>Support for STDIN reading and STDOUT writing added. This can be
used when calling TaskJuggler from CGI scripts.

</itemize>

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>Obtaining TaskJuggler 
<p>

TaskJuggler may be obtained from the following web site:

<htmlurl url="http://www.suse.de/~freitag/taskjuggler"
name="http://www.suse.de/~freitag/taskjuggler/">

<sect1>Requirements
<p>

To build and run TaskJuggler, you need:

<itemize>

<item>qt3 &mdash; The <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source"
name="qt c++ class library"> version 3

<item> gcc 2.95 &mdash; The <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu"
name="GNU C compiler"> version 2.95. The c++ extensions must be
available.

</itemize>

This version of TaskJuggler was built and tested on SuSE Linux 8.0 on
various hardware platforms.

<sect1>Compilation and Installation
<p>

To compile and install TaskJuggler on your system, type the following 
in the base directory of the TaskJuggler distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since TaskJuggler uses <tt/autoconf/, you should have no trouble
compiling it.  If you have problems, please report them to the
TaskJuggler developers mailing list at <htmlurl
url="mailto:taskjuggler-devel@suse.de"
name="taskjuggler-devel@suse.de"> in English.


<p>
<sect> Usage <p>
<sect1> Basics
<p>

TaskJuggler uses one or more text files to describe a project. The main
project should be placed in a file with the <tt/.tjp/ extension. This
main project may contain several subprojects. Such subprojects should be
placed in files with the <tt/.tjsp/ extension. These subprojects are
included in the main project during compile time.

<sect1> General Usage
<p>

TaskJuggler works like a compiler. You provide the source files, it computes
the contents and creates the output files.

<p>
After you created the project description file, have TaskJuggler 
compute and create the output. For example, if you have created the
<tt>AcSo.tjp</tt> project file. You need to send this file to TaskJuggler then:

<tscreen><verb>
% taskjuggler AcSo.tjp
</verb></tscreen>

TaskJuggler will try to schedule all tasks with the specified
conditions and generate the reports that were requested with the <ref
id="htmltaskreport" name="htmltaskreport">, <ref
id="htmlresourcereport" name="htmlresourcereport"> or other report
attributes in the input file(s).

Calling TaskJuggler with . as input filename will cause reading from
stdin. To redirect output to stdout you can specify -- as filename
for reports. This feature can for example be used to generate dynamic
html pages from CGI scripts.

<sect1> The Command Line Options
<p>

To get a list of the command line options of TaskJuggler, use the <tt>--help</tt>
option:

<tscreen><verb>
% taskjuggler --help
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1> Reporting Bugs and Sending Feedback
<p>
All official releases of TaskJuggler are meant to be stable releases
unless explicitly noted differently. But our test suite is still very
small and some features cannot be tested automatically very well. So
it's very likely that your current version of TaskJuggler contains
bugs. If you find a bug please follow this procedure:

<itemize>

<item>Read this manual to make sure that it is actually a bug and not
a feature.

<item>Check the TaskJuggler <htmlurl
url="http://www.suse.de/~freitag/taskjuggler" name="web page">.
Possibly the bug was already found and a patch or workaround exists.

<item>Try to create a test project that is as small as possible but
still reproduces the bug.

<item>Send the test project and a detailed description of the problem
to the developer mailing list at <htmlurl
url="mailto:taskjuggler-devel@suse.de"
name="taskjuggler-devel@suse.de">.

</itemize>

<sect>An Example
<p>

The easiest way to give an overview of the functionality of TaskJuggler is
with an example.

<sect1> Introducing the Example: Accounting Software
<p>

Refer to section <ref id="example" name="The Example: Accounting
Software"> for a printout of the example.

In this project, we plan to create an accounting program. The project
starts on January 16, 2002, and its end is planned for June 30, 2002. The
project will consist of the following tasks:

<descrip>
<tag/Specification/The developers set up the specification for the
software and documentation.
<tag/Software development/This is the whole process of coding the software. It
includes the following subtasks:
  <descrip>
  <tag/Database coupling/Connection procedures to the database.
  <tag/Graphical user interface/Creating the user interface.
  <tag/Back-end functions/Creating the calucation and computing routines for the
  data.
  </descrip>

<tag/Software testing/Testing the software. There are two stages of software
testing:
  <descrip>
  <tag/Alpha test/Test the software in alpha stage.
  <tag/Beta test/Test the software in beta stage. The customer normally takes
  part in this beta test phase.
  </descrip>

<tag/Manual/Creating the printed user manual

<tag/Ship to customer/This task includes all steps necessary to communicate
to the customer. This is an important task, as it defines the basic milestones
of the project. For example, we cannot start the project before the contract
is signed. It is also important to check the planned date of shipping the
software to the customer.

This process consist of the following subtasks:
  <descrip>
  <tag/Projectstart/This milestone defines the start of the project.
  <tag/Betaversion/This marks the start of the beta test. Normally, the
  customer wants to see a beta version, so this is also a milestone.
  <tag/Ship product to customer/This is the date when the project has ended.
  Software is in final stage, the manual is ready and printed, and everything is
  shipped to the customer.
  </descrip>
</descrip>

<sect> The Basic Parts of a <tt>.tjp</tt> File
<p>

This section gives an overview of the most important commands, properties,
and attributes used in a typical project file. Refer to <ref
id="reference" name="Property Reference"> for a complete list of commands and
properties usable in project files.

<descrip>
<tag>project acso "Accounting Software" "1.0" 2002-01-16 2002-06-30</tag>

This statement informs TaskJuggler about the most important things on the
project. These things include:

<descrip>
<tag/fibu/The project ID, unique within the scope of the project
<tag/Accounting Software/The short description of the project
<tag/1.0/The version of the schedule
<tag/2002-01-16 2002-6-30/Begin and end dates of the project
</descrip>

Refer to the <ref id="project" name="project"> command in the reference
for details.

<tag>resource dev "Developers" { ... }</tag>

This defines a resource with the unique ID <tt/dev/. It will be shown as
<tt/Developers/ on the schedule later.

<descrip>
<tag/dev/The resource ID, unique for TaskJuggler
<tag/Developers/The real name of the resource
</descrip>

In the example, the resource consists of the three developers (<tt/dev1/,
<tt/dev2/, and <tt/dev3/). For every resource, you can specify additional
attributes in separate curly braces {}.

Refer to the <ref id="resource" name="resource"> command in the
reference for details.

<tag>task AcSo "Accounting Software" { ... }</tag>

This defines the task <tt/AcSo/. In this example, it represents the whole
project to build the Accounting Software. A task may contain several subtasks.

Refer to the <ref id="task" name="task"> command in the reference.

<tag>htmltaskreport "tasks.html" name,start,end,resources,weekly</tag>

This command creates a task-based report in html and saves it as
<tt/tasks.html/ to the current directory. The report will include the task
name, start and end of the task, and the necessary resources. The report's 
resolution will be in weeks.

Refer to the <ref id="htmltaskreport" name="htmltaskreport"> command in
the reference for details.
</descrip>

<sect> Other Useful Commands and Environments
<p>

<descrip> 
<tag> <tt/now 2002-02-17/</tag>

This sets the current date to 2002-02-17. This is the day or week that will be
highlighted in the report later. This helps with printing and creating reports for
the future.

<tag> <tt/rate 310.0/</tag>

<tag> <tt/currency "EUR"/</tag>

Sets the global monetary currency to Euro. It is used for printing out cost and
revenue values in the correct currency.

<tag> <tt/account dev "Development" cost {}/</tag>

This creates an account <tt/dev/ as a <tt/cost/ account. There is also a
account type <tt/revenue/, which is used to cover all kinds of income (see
reference: <ref id="account" name="account">).
</descrip>

<sect>Property Reference<p><label id="reference">

<bf>Comments</bf><p><label id="comments">
There are two ways to annotate a project file with comments. All text
after a '#' will be ignored. Comments that span multiple rows must be
started with '/*' and ended with '*/'.

<descrip>

<label id="date"><tag/DATE/A DATE is an ISO-compliant date in the
format YYYY-MM-DD[-hh:mm[:ss]][-TIMEZONE]. Hour, minutes,
seconds and the TIMEZONE are optional. If not specified, the values
are set to 0. The local timezone is used if no other is specified. If
the timezone is not known taskjuggler will fall back to UTC. See
the source code (taskjuggler/Utility.cpp) for details. 

<label id="global_id"><tag/GLOBAL_ID/A GLOBAL_ID may have the same
characters as ID, but additionally may contain '.' and '!'. '!' may
only be used at the beginning and is used in relative IDs. A '!' means
one level up.

<label id="id"><tag/ID/A string that may consist of the characters
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _.  It may not start with a number.

<label id="integer"><tag/INTEGER/A number that is an integer.

<label id="logicalexpression"><tag/LOGICALEXPRESSION/This is a logical
expression consisting of logical operations, such as '&' for and, '|'
for or, and '&tilde;' for not, to operate on INTEGER values or
symbols. As symbols flag names and certain functions are supported.
The expression is evaluated from left to right. '&tilde;' has a higher
precedence than other operators. Use braces to avoid ambiguous
operations. If flagFoo, flagFooBar, and flagBar are declared flags,
the following example is a correct expression:

(flagFoo | flagFooBar) & &tilde;flagBar

The following functions can be used in logical expressions:

<descrip>
<tag/containstask(<ref id="id" name="ID">)/ true if the task has task
ID as sub task.  <tag/ismilestone()/ true if the task is a milestone.
<tag/issubtask(<ref id="id" name="ID">)/ true if the task is a sub
task of task ID.  <tag/istask(<ref id="id" name="ID">)/ true if the
tasks has the listed ID.  <tag/isresource(<ref id="id" name="ID">)/
true if the resource has the listed ID.  <tag/isaccount(<ref id="id"
name="ID">)/ true if the account has the listed ID.

</descrip>

The export report looks like a regular taskjuggler file but contains
fixed start and end dates for all tasks. The tasks only have start and
end times, their description and their project id listed. No other
attributes are exported.

If requested the resource usage for the tasks is reported as well. But
only those allocations are listed that belong to tasks listed in the
same export report.

The export report can be used to share certain tasks or milestones
with other projects. When an export report is included the project IDs
of the included tasks must be declared first with the <ref
name="projectid property" id="projectid">.


<sect1>flags &lt;id&gt;&lsqb;,&lt;id&gt;&rsqb;<label id="flags">
<p>
id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

Declares the specified flags. Flags can be assigned to tasks,
resources, or accounts to be used as filters during report
generation. It is legal to declare a flag more than once.

<sect1>supplement &lt;task|resource&gt; &lt;ID&gt;<label id="completion">
<p>
ID: <ref id="id">
<p>
The supplement keyword provides a mechanism to add more attributes to
already defined tasks or resources. The additional attributes must
obey the same rules as in regular task or resource definitions and
must be enclosed by curly braces.

This construct is primerily meant for situations where the information
about a task or resource is split over serveral files. E. g. the
vacation dates for the resources may be in a seperate file that was
generated by some other tool.

Specifies that the task cannot start before the task with the
specified <ref id="id" name="ID">s have been finished. If multiple
<ref id="id" name="ID">s are specified, they must be separated by
commas. IDs must be either global or relative. A relative <ref id="id"
name="ID"> starts with a number of '!'. Each '!' moves the scope to
the parent task. Global <ref id="id" name="ID">s do not contain '!',
but have <ref id="id" name="ID">s separated by dots.

Example:
<tscreen><verb>
task foo1 {
   task foo2 { start 2002-12-04 }
   task foo3 { depends !foo2 }
}
task bar { depends foo1.foo2 }
</verb></tscreen>

By using the 'depends' attribute, the scheduling policy is
automatically set to ASAP. If 'depends' and 'preceeds' are used, the
last policy counts.

unit: <ref id="unit" name="UNIT">

Specifies the effort needed to complete the task. An effort of 4d can
be done with 2 full-time resources in 2 days.

WARNING: In almost all real world projects effort is not the product
of time and resources. This is only true if the task can be
partitioned without adding any overhead. For more information about
this read "The Mythical Man-Month" by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.

Tasks may not have subtasks if this attribute is used.

id: GLOBAL_<ref id="id" name="ID">

Specifies that this task preceeds the tasks with the specified <ref
id="id" name="ID">s. If multiple tasks are specified, they must be
separated by commas. The format is equivalent to the 'depends'
attribute.

By using the <tt/preceeds/ attribute, the <ref name="scheduling
policy" id="task_scheduling"> is automatically set to ALAP. If
<ref name="depends" id="task_depends"> and <tt/preceeds/ are used, the
last policy counts.


<label id="task_priority">
<tag/priority &lt;value&gt;/
value: <ref id="integer" name="INTEGER">

Specifies a priority between 1 and 1000. A task with higher priority
is more likely to get the requested resources.

<tag/responsible &lt;id&gt;/
id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

The ID of the resource that is responsible for this task.

This attribute is inherited by subtasks if specified prior to the
definition of the subtask.

<tag/scheduling &lt;policy&gt;/
policy: <ref id="id" name="ID">

This specifies the scheduling policy for the task. Possible values are:

<descrip>
<tag/ALAP/As late as possible. The task is scheduled to happen as late as
possible.

<tag/ASAP/As soon as possible. The task is scheduled to happen as early as
possible.
</descrip>

The scheduling policy is automatically changed if the <ref
name="depends" id="task_depends"> or <ref name="preceeds"
id="task_preceeds"> attributes are used. If multiple attributes that
affect the scheduling policy are used, that last attribute determines
the effective policy.


<label id="task_start">
<tag/start &lt;date&gt;/
date: <ref id="date" name="DATE">

The planned start date for the task. If no start date is given,
the task must depend on other tasks. If no dependency is given, the
project start date is used. Setting a start date will switch the
scheduling policy to ASAP.

Tasks may be nested and some attributes are inherited by the subtasks.


<sect1>timingresolution &lt;value&gt; &lt;unit&gt;<label id="timingresolution">
<p>
value: INTERGER

unit: <ref id="unit" name="UNIT">

Sets the minimum timing resolution. The smaller the value, the longer
the schedulings process requires. The default is 1 hour. The smallest
value is 5 min.


<sect1>vacation name &lt;start&gt; &lsqb;- &lt;end&gt;&rsqb;<label id="vacationname">
<p>
name: <ref id="string" name="STRING">

start: <ref id="date" name="DATE">

end: <ref id="date" name="DATE">

Defines a vacation period for all resources. The end value is NOT part
of the vacation. So 2001-12-24 - 2001-12-25 specifies one day of
vacation, not two days.


<sect1>workinghours &lt;weekday&gt; &lt;from&gt;-&lt;to&gt;&lsqb;,&lt;from&gt;-&lt;to&gt;&rsqb;<label id="hours">
