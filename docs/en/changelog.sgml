<itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para> Added some reports to the example file, so users
actually get a result of the TaskJuggler run.</para>

<listitem><para> Support for later completion of task and resources
added. By writing 'supplement task &lt;ID&gt; { ... }' an already
defined task can be extended. So it's easier now to create a file
which contains the vacations for all resources separate from the
resource definition itself. </para>

<listitem><para>Extended expression parser to work on string type
values as well.</para>

<listitem><para><link linkend="logicalexpression"> logicalexpression
</link> for hidetask, rolluptask etc. can now contain functions as

reports by using the <link linkend="htmltaskreport_rawstylesheet">

quotes. A single quoted string may contain double quotes and vice

<sect2><title>Version 1.3 (2002-07-30)</title>

<para> <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>

<listitem><para>This release features some bigger cleanup changes.
Some of them do break compatibility with older version of taskjuggler.
While we try very hard to avoid such situations, we do prefer to have
a consistent and logical language. Since the TaskJuggler user base is
still comparatively small, we decided to break compatibility now
rather than later. The changes are fairly minor, so they won't affect
many users.  Please see further down for more details.</para>

<listitem><para>Added Perl/Tk tool to view Gantt charts and other
project information.</para>

<listitem><para>Added PERT-chart generator from Philippe
Midol-Monnet.</para>

the next major release.</para>

<listitem><para><link

fixed. <computeroutput>startup</computeroutput>,
	<computeroutput>startdown</computeroutput>,
	<computeroutput>endup</computeroutput> and
	<computeroutput>enddown</computeroutput> have been replaced by

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The optional attribute <link
linkend="include_taskprefix">taskprefix</link> has been added to <link
linkend="include">include</link>. This allows other projects to be
added at arbitrary points in the task tree as sub
projects.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Include statements within tasks are no longer
supported. They lead to ambiguous interpretation of
certain attributes.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The optional attribute <link
linkend="export_taskroot">taskroot</link> has been added to <link
linkend="export">export</link>. This allows to export sub tasks of a
tasks to be exported as root-level tasks.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The project file reader has been made fully Unicode
aware. It is now possible to use non-ASCII characters in text strings
and comments.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Two new functions have been added for use in <link
linkend="logicalexpression">logical expressions</link>.
<computeroutput>isplanallocated</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>isactualallocated</computeroutput> can be used to show
only resources that have been allocated to a certain project in a
given time frame.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Made week of year calculation ISO 8601:1988 and DIN
1355 compliant. This also affects the month and year correlation in
weekly reports. You can use the optional project attributes <link

linkend="project_weekstartsmonday"> weekstartsmonday </link> to
specify whether you like to start you week on Sunday or
Monday.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Support for a <computeroutput>flags</computeroutput>
columns added to HTML reports.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Sub tasks do now inherit the dependencies of their
container tasks. Specifying dependencies after sub tasks is now
illegal since they would be only used for checking, but not for
scheduling.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The logic checker for task attributes has been
completely rewritten. Since it probably catches some more errors, you
might have to fix your project now. Such cases would have resulted in
wrong results anyhow. Lots of test cases have been added to the test
suite to validate the checker.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The error reporting has been drastically improved. The
messages should be more precise now and errors that are triggered by
other errors should be not so prominent anymore.</para></listitem>

generate weekly calendars.</para></listitem>

Philippe.</para></listitem>

resource reports can now be turned on and off using the <link
linkend="htmltaskreport_barlabels"> barlabels </link>
attribute.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The HTML reports feature now 3 kind of index numbers.
The sequence number reflects the order of declaration in the project
files. The index is a logical order based on the hierarchy and other
attributes. The number is the index in the generated list. What used
to be the <computeroutput>no</computeroutput> <link
linkend="htmltaskreport_columns">column</link> is now the
<computeroutput>index</computeroutput> column.</para></listitem>

nested resources. The bug was introduced between versions 1.2 and 1.3.

problems with a sub task no error message was generated. This has been
fixed now.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fixed scheduling of container tasks, so that container
tasks with only milestones get properly scheduled.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Only export min/max start/end times when they were
explicitly specified and do no longer inherit project start/end times
for this purpose.</para></listitem>
