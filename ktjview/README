ktjview - TaskJuggler output viewer
-----------------------------------

ktjview is the first approach to have a graphical output of the taskjuggler
results. Build it and it acts as Konqueror view. Therefore it only needs to
be installed (which installs the binary and the desktopfile describing the
service). The service is registerd for mimetype text/tjx.

To try ktjview, simply
- configure taskjuggler with --with-kde-support switch and compile.
- create a xml taskreport and name its extension tjx, eg. use
xmltaskreport "./thisdir/myProject.tjx"
in your tjp-File.

- open ktjview and open myProject.tjx
- open myProject.tjx by clicking on it in konqueror if you have registered
  the mimetype for it.

Note that ktjview is the first try. It is not really usefull yet, but we
are working on it.
