The vim settings have been contributed by Peter Poeml <poeml@suse.de>.

To use them you need to do one of the following:

Possibility 1
=============

For newer versions of vim it might be enough to:

1) Copy the tjp.vim file into the vim syntax directory (e.g.
/usr/share/vim/vim70/syntax)

2) Add the following lines to your local vimrc file (e.g. ~/.vimrc or
~/.vimrc.local or something similar)

.vimrc
       augroup taskjuggler
       " taskjuggler files
       au! BufNewFile,BufRead *.tj{p,i} set ft=tjp
       augroup END


Possibility 2
=============

For a more generic approach try to add the following lines to the
respective files:
.vimrc:
       let myfiletypefile = "~/.vim/filetypes.vim"
       let myscriptsfile  = "~/.vim/scripts.vim"
       let mysyntaxfile   = "~/.vim/syntax.vim"
       syntax on
       syn sync maxlines=500
       syn sync minlines=300



~/.vim/filetypes.vim:
       augroup filetype
       "
       " [...]
       "
       " taskjuggler files
       au! BufNewFile,BufRead *.tj{p,i} set ft=tjp
       augroup END


~/.vim/syntax.vim:
       au! Syntax tjp         so ~/.vim/tjp.vim
