This is what may become a real testsuite. There are 2 classes of
tests; Syntactical tests and scheduler tests. For each class there are
tests that must pass and tests that must fail. All *.tjp files that
are found in the respective directories are executed by the test
suite. You can run the test suite by executing ./runtests in the
TestSuite directory.

If you want to help the taskjuggler development you can help to
complete the test suite. Ideally each syntax struct should have a pass
and at least one fail test.
