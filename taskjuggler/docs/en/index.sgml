<sect>Introduction
<p>
<sect1>What is TaskJuggler
<p>

TaskJuggler is a project management tool. It helps you to organize and plan
projects in your company. It schedules the whole project and tries to optimize
the resources needed for the project.

The output can either be a report showing the several tasks, the resource usage
or the account information. The report is created as a html file which enables
an easy display via a WEB browser.

<p>

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain TaskJuggler 
<p>

TaskJuggler my be obtained from the author of the software (<htmlurl
url="mailto:cs@suse.de" name = "Chris Schlaeger">).

<sect1>Requirements
<p>

To build and run TaskJuggler you need:

<itemize>
<item>qt3 - The qt c++ class library in version 3
<item> gcc 2.96 - The GNU C compiler in version 2.96. The c++ extensions must be
available
</itemize>

This version of TaskJuggler was built and tested on SuSE Linux 7.3/x86

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install TaskJuggler on your system, type the following 
in the base directory of the TaskJuggler distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since TaskJuggler uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at 
<htmlurl url="mailto:cs@suse.de" name = "Chris Schlaeger">


<p>
<sect> Usage <p>
<sect1> Basics
<p>

TaskJuggler uses one or more ASCII files to describe a project. The main
project should be placed in a file with the <tt>.tjp</tt> extension. This
main project may contain several sub projects. Such sub projects should be
placed in files with the <tt>.tjsp</tt> extension. These sub projects are
included into the main project during compile time.

<sect1> General Usage
<p>

TaskJuggler works like a compiler. You provide the source files, it computes
its contents and creates an output in HTML.

<p>
After you created the project description file, you have TaskJuggler let it
compute and create the output. Let's say, you have created the
<tt>AcSo.tjp</tt> project file. You need to send this file to TaskJuggler then:

<tscreen><verb>
% taskjuggler AcSo.tjp
</verb></tscreen>

TaskJuggler will create the type of report you have specified in the
<tt>AcSo.tjp</tt> file.

<sect1> The Command Line Options
<p>

To get a list of the command line options of taskjugger use the <tt>--help</tt>
option:

<tscreen><verb>
% taskjuggler --help
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>An Example
<p>

The easiest way to give you an overview of the functionality of TaskJuggler is
with an example.

<sect1> Introducing the Example: Accounting Software
<p>

Please refer to section <ref id="example" name="The Example: Accounting
Software"> for a printout of the example.

In this project, we plan to create an accounting software. The projects
starts on Jan. 16th 2002 and it's end is planned for 30th of June 2002. The
project will consist of the following tasks:

<descrip>
<tag/Specifiaction/The developers will set up the specifiaction for the
software and documentation.
<tag/Software development/This is the whole process of coding the software. It
include the following sub tasks:
  <descrip>
  <tag/Database coupling/Connection procedures to the database.
  <tag/Grahpical user interface/Creating the user interface.
  <tag/Backend functions/Creating the calucation and computing routines for the
  data.
  </descrip>

<tag/Software testing/Testing the software. There are two stages of software
testing:
  <descrip>
  <tag/Alpha test/Test the software in alpha stage.
  <tag/Beta test/Test the software in beta stage. The customer normally takes
  part in this beta test phase.
  </descrip>

<tag/Manual/Creating the printed user manual

<tag/Ship to customer/This task includes all steps necessary to communicate
to the customer. This is an important task, as it defines the basic milestones
of the project. For example, we cannot start the project before the contract
is signed. It is also important to check the planned date of shipping the
software to the customer.

This process consist of the following sub tasks:
  <descrip>
  <tag/Projectstart/This milestone defines the start of the project.
  <tag/Betaversion/This marks the start of the beta test. Normally the
  customer wants to see a beta version. So this is also a milestone.
  <tag/Ship product to customer/This is the date when the project has ended.
  Software is in final stage, the manual is ready and printed and everyting is
  shipped to the customer.
  </descrip>
</descrip>

<sect> The basic parts of a <tt>.tjp</tt> file
<p>

This section gives you an overview on the most important commands, properties
and attributes used in a typical project file. Please refer to <ref
id="reference" name="Command Reference"> for a complete list of commands and
properties usable in project files.

<descrip>
<tag>project fibu "Accounting Software" "1.0" 2002-01-16 2002-06-30</tag>

This statement informs TaskJuggler about the most important things on the
project. These things include:

<descrip>
<tag/fibu/The project name, unique for TaskJuggler
<tag/Accounting Software/The real name of the project
<tag/1.0/The version of the schedule
<tag/2002-01-16 2002-6-30/Begin and end date of the project
</descrip>

Please refer to the <ref id="project" name="project"> command in the reference
for details.

<tag>resource dev "Developers" { ... }</tag>

This defines a resource with the unique name <tt/dev/. It will be shown as
<tt/Developers/ on the schedule later.

<descrip>
<tag/dev/The resource name, unique for TaskJuggler
<tag/Developers/The real name of the resource
</descrip>

In the example, the resource consists of the three developers (<tt/dev1/,
<tt/dev2/ and <tt/dev3/). For every resource, you can specify some additional
attributes in separate curly brackets {}.

Please refer to the <ref id="resource" name="resource"> command in the
reference for details.

<tag>task AcSo "Accounting Software" { ... }</tag>

This defines the task <tt/AcSo/. In this example, it represents the whole
project to build the Accounting Software. A task may contain several sub tasks.

Please refer to the <ref id="task" name="task"> command in the reference.
</descrip>

<sect> Other useful commands and environments
<p>

<descrip> 
<tag> <tt/now 2002-02-17/</tag>

This sets the current date to 2002-02-17. This is the day/week that will be
higlighted in the report later. This helps you printing/creating reports for
the future.

<tag> <tt/rate 310.0/</tag>

<tag> <tt/currency "EUR"/</tag>

Sets the global monetary currency to Euro. It is used for printing out cost and
revenue values in the correct currency.

<tag> <tt/account dev "Development" cost {}/</tag>

This creates an account <tt/dev/ as a <tt/cost/ account. There is also a
account type <tt/revenue/ (see reference: <ref id="account" name="account">).
</descrip>

<sect>Command Reference<p><label id="reference">

<sect1>Comments<p><label id="comments">
There are two ways to annotate a project file with comments. All text
after a '#' will be ignored. Comments that span multiple rows must be
started with '/*' and ended with '*/'.

<sect1>Attributes<p><label id="attributes">

Attributes may be of the following types:

<descrip>
<label id="id"><tag/ID/A string that may consist of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and _.
It may not start with a number

additionally it may contain '.' and '!'. '!' may only be used at the
beginning and is used in relative IDs. A '!' means one scope up

<label id="string"><tag/STRING/A string may contain any characters and is enclosed in '"'. A
string may include line breaks

or symbols. As symbols currently only flag names are supported. The
expression is evaluated from left to right. '~' has a higher
precedance than other operators. Use braces to avoid ambigous
operations. If flagFoo, flagFooBar and flagBar are declared flags, the
following example is a correct expression:

(flagFoo | flagFooBar) & ~flagBar

<label id="sortingcriteria"><tag/SORTINGCRITERIA/See attribute description for allowed values
</descrip>

Optional attributes of a property must be enclosed by {}.

<sect1>project &lt;id&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;version&gt; &lt;start&gt;
&lt;end&gt;<label id="project">

resource allocations in a global database. &lt;name&gt; is the name of the
project. &lt;version&gt; is the version of the project file. Typically this
is the CVS id. &lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt; define the timeframe of the

be specified to terminate the scheduling process.

<sect1>task &lt;id&gt; &lt;name&gt;<label id="task">
<p>

id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

name: <ref id="string" name="STRING">

Optional attributes:

<descrip>
<tag/task &lt;id&gt; &lt;name&gt;/
id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

text: <ref id="string" name="STRING">

A longer description of the task.

<tag/start &lt;date&gt;/
date: <ref id="date" name="DATE">

The planned start date for the task. In case no start date is given,
the task must depend on other tasks. If no dependency is given the
project start date is used. Setting a start date will switch the
scheduling policy to ASAP.

<tag/end &lt;date&gt;/
date: <ref id="date" name="DATE">

The planned end date for the task. In case no end date is given, the
task must depend on other tasks. If no dependency is given the project
start date is used. Setting and end date will switch the scheduling
policy to ALAP.

<tag/minstart &lt;date&gt;/
date: <ref id="date" name="DATE">

The earliest wanted start date for the task. In case this date can't
be met the task is marked in the task list.

This attribute is inherited by sub tasks.

<tag/maxstart &lt;date&gt;/
date: <ref id="date" name="DATE">

The latest wanted start date for the task. In case this date can't be
met the task is marked in the task list.

This attribute is inherited by sub tasks.

plan/actual comparisons.

<tag/length &lt;number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;/
number: <ref id="real" name="REAL">

unit: <ref id="unit" name="UNIT">

Specifies the time the task occupies the resources. This is working
time, not calender time. 7d means 7 working days and not one week.

<tag/duration &lt;number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;/
number: <ref id="real" name="REAL">

unit: <ref id="unit" name="UNIT">

Specifies the time the task occupies the resources. This is calender
time, not working time. 7d means one week.

<tag/effort &lt;number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;/
number: <ref id="real" name="REAL">

unit: <ref id="unit" name="UNIT">

Specifies the effort needed to complete the task. An effort of 4d can
be done with 2 full-time resources in 2 days.

<tag/complete &lt;percent&gt;/
percent: <ref id="integer" name="INTEGER">

Specifies how many percent the task is already completed. This can be
usefull for project tracking.

Optional attributes:

<descrip>
<tag/load &lt;days&gt;/
days: <ref id="real" name="REAL">

Specifies how many days the resource can be used per day for this
task. A load of 0.5 means that the resource will be used for at most
half a working day for this task.

<tag/alternative &lt;id&gt;&lsqb,&lt;id&gt;&rsqb;/
id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

Specifies <ref id="id" name="ID">s of alternative resources. One of the alternatives will
be used in case the main resource is not available. If multiple
resources are used they must be seperated by a comma.

<tag/persistent/

If set the first available resource out of the specified resource and
it's specified alternatives will be used for the whole task.
</descrip>


Specifies a resource that can be used to fullfill the task. More than
one resource can be  specified for a task. All resources must be
declared before they can be used. Ref. 'resource'. Resource
allocations are mandatory for 'effort' based tasks. Task with a
'length' or 'duration' specification may have resources allocated but
do not require them.

<tag/scheduling &lt;policy&gt;/
policy: <ref id="id" name="ID">

This specifies the scheduling policy for the task. Possible values are:

<descrip>
<tag/ASAP/As soon as possible. The task is scheduled to happen as early as
possible.

<tag/ALAP/As late as possible. The task is scheduled to happen as late as
possible.
</descrip>

The scheduling policy is automatically changed if the 'depends' or 
'preceeds' attributes are used. If multiple attributes that affect the
scheduling policy are used, that last attribute determines the
effective policy.

<tag/depends &lt;id&gt;&lsqb,&lt;id&gt;&rsqb;/
id: GLOBAL_<ref id="id" name="ID">

Specifies that the task cannot start before the task with the
specified <ref id="id" name="ID">s have been finished. If multiple <ref id="id" name="ID">s are specified they
must be seperated by a comma. ids must be either global or relative. A
relative <ref id="id" name="ID"> starts with a number of '!'. Each '!' moves the scope to the
parent task. Global <ref id="id" name="ID">s do not contain '!' but have <ref id="id" name="ID">s seperated by
dots.

Example:
<tscreen><verb>
task foo1 {
   task foo2 { start 2002-12-04 }
   task foo3 { depends !foo2 }
}
   task bar { depends foo1.foo2 }
</verb></tscreen>

By using the 'depends' attribute the scheduling policy is
automatically set to ASAP. If 'depends' and 'preceeds' are used the
last policy counts.

<tag/preceeds &lt;id&gt;&lsqb;,&lt;id&gt;&rsqb;/
id: GLOBAL_<ref id="id" name="ID">

Specifies that this tasks preceeds the tasks with the specified
<ref id="id" name="ID">s. If multiple tasks are specified they must be seperated by a
comma. The format is equivalent to the 'depends' attribute.

By using the 'preceeds' attribute the scheduling policy is
automatically set to ALAP. If 'depends' and 'preceeds' are used the
last policy counts.

<tag/flags &lt;id&gt;&lsqb;,&lt;id&gt;&rsqb;/
id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

Attaches flags to the task. Flags can be used to hide the information
about the task in the output. Flags must be declared before they can
be used. Ref. 'flags'.

Flags are inherited by sub tasks from their parent tasks if they are
declared before the sub task. Flags that are declared after the sub
tasks are NOT inherited.

<tag/responsible &lt;id&gt;/
id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

The id of the resource that is responsible for this task.

This attribute is inherited by sub tasks if specified prior to the
definition of the sub task.

<tag/priority &lt;value&gt;/
value: <ref id="integer" name="INTEGER">

Specifies a priority between 1 and 1000. A task with higher priority
is more likely to get the requested resources.

This attribute is inherited by sub tasks if specified prior to the
definition of the sub task.

<tag/account &lt;id&gt;/
id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

Specifies the account that all costs associated with this task will be
credited to.

This attribute is inherited by sub tasks if specified prior to the
definition of the sub task.

<tag/startcredit &lt;amount&gt;/
amount: <ref id="real" name="REAL">

Specifies an amount that is credited to the account specified by the
'account' property at the moment the tasks starts.

<tag/endcredit &lt;amount&gt;/
amount: <ref id="real" name="REAL">

Specifies an amount that is credited to the account specified by the
'account' property at the moment the tasks ends.

Tasks may be nested and some attributes are inherited by the sub tasks.

sub-accounts inherit this type. The type may be 'Cost' or 'Revenue'.

<sect1>resource &lt;id&gt; &lt;name&gt;<label id="resource">
<p>

id: <ref id="id" name="ID">

name: <ref id="string" name="STRING">

Optional attributes:

<descrip>
<tag/resource &lt;id&gt; &lt;name&gt;/
Resources may be nested to create groups. A nested resource inherits

inherited that have been specified prior to the declaration of the
nested resource.
<tag/mineffort &lt;value&gt;/
value: <ref id="real" name="REAL">

The daily minimum effort for a resource. Resources that are
used less than this value will be marked in the report.

specified for a day, the global definitions are used. If no working
hours should be specified for a day the keyword 'off' must be used
instead of the time interval.

</descrip>
When several resource have the same working hours these working hours
should be defined as shifts. Each shift must have a unique <ref id="id" name="ID">.
